# techdegree-7-react-gallery-app

In this project, I used the React library to create an image gallery app. I used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion. I used Axios to fetch API data from flickr and display photos it to the browser. I created a search component so that users could displays new photos by submitting keywords to the search bar. I created several component files to bring the app together and set up routes for each file by using React router.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
